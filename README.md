Gemsbok
=======

Got me a fresh new VR unit, and I want to make games for it. Need a simple project to start. So
let's Hunt the Wumpus! \*crowd cheers\*

No timeline on this, doing it as I get through it. Flavor will be greatly changed from the original
game. Additions to the game will come as I feel like.

You can see my wonderful programmer art now! I’m working on a base mesh to test out VR
Integration. Still using some placeholder art for the floor and skybox.

[Here is the Trello board for the game](https://trello.com/b/Q5PHfHof/gemsbok-project-board)
