Gemsbok
=======

Got me a fresh new VR unit, and I want to make games for it. Need a simple project to start. So
let's Hunt the Wumpus! \*crowd cheers\*

No timeline on this, doing it as I get through it. Flavor will be greatly changed from the original
game. Additions to the game will come as I feel like.

We’re much further along than last time I updated this README. In VR, the model now roughly maps to
your position, and uses your controllers as IK input. The dungeon is generated, and in VR can be
traversed by pointing the controller at the door. If you end up in a Hazard, an animation will play
and either end the game or teleport you to another room.

There is now also a HUD (just the smaller HUD for now), but I did this while I was away from the VR
Unit, so it’s not actually there in VR, though I’ve not tested. Next up is traversal without VR, and
a full HUD showing the history. I’ll probably be back at home by then so I’ll probably be able to
update SteamVR, and to have the HUD accessible in VR too.

After that, it’s implementing the arrow, and we’d have a playable game!
