Gemsbok
=======

Got me a fresh new VR unit, and I want to make games for it. Need a simple project to start. So
let's Hunt the Wumpus! \*crowd cheers\*

No timeline on this, doing it as I get through it. Flavor will be greatly changed from the original
game. Additions to the game will come as I feel like.

All of the more artistic aspects are merely placeholders for now, particularly [Unity-Chan](http://unity-chan.com/)
as a placeholder player character.

[Here is the Trello board for the game](https://trello.com/b/Q5PHfHof/gemsbok-project-board)
